ðŸ˜€Hi, I'm Liy. I'm creating Puppet & Brain! A creative platform with node based visual scripting for children to learn simple game programming and programming concepts.

I used to work in a special needs company until redundancy happened October 2017ðŸ˜…. I developed games and applications for children with learning and emotional difficulties, physical disability or sensory impairment.

For the past few months, I've been working on Puppet & Brain using my redundancy compensation. I do design, programming, illustration and animations... basically everything. It is really hard work but I'm enjoying it. I know somewhere, there will be a group of people who will be benefited by my work. 

Luckily, my aunt recently started helping me to market this project, but unfortunately it is not working very well at the moment. The project does not have enough contents: animations, sticker arts, sound effects, music and ready to use game and activities.

I would like to work full-time on this project. I do feel this project has its own value in education and game sector. And I would like to invite you to join me on this project.

What is Patreon?

Patreon is a website enable you to help creators through monthly payment. You will be able to directly support creator's passion and help them to avoid distractions such as side work. Plus, creators usually have plenty of rewards for you! 

What is Puppet & Brain?

In short, Puppet & Brain is a web application allows children to make simple games and activities by connecting visual nodes. 

You might know MIT Scratch, Google Blockly or other children programming platforms. Most of them are based on Google Blockly, and has jigsaw style block which mimic line by line text based coding. It simulates the code execution by stacking blocks together.

If you are not a game developer or 3D artist, you probably never heard of node based visual scripting, or node based graph system before. Instead of mimic lines of code from a program, node based graph system focus on the execution and data flow of a program, and it is so intuitive that non-programmers such as artists can also use it to program simple logic.

I wrote a node based visual scripting system from scratch using JavaScript for Puppet & Brain. I believe this project can fill some of the gaps in teaching children programming. After all, programming is not about typing text line by line. The logic, pattern, data and execution flow are the fundamental concepts of the programming. Plus, children can get the first experience on the node based visual scripting, which are used in all the major AAA game engines, such as Unreal Engine, Unity(Bolt, and other 3rd party plugins), CryEngine. Not mention that graphics applications like Maya, Blender and Substance Designer... they also have node based graph system.

I've got the visual scripting system, the basic web application and the simple backend ready. But I still need time and money to prepare arts, animations and creating regular games and activities in order to inspire children. Of course fixing bugs and adding features as well!

Why join me on this project?

If you have children or you are a teacher, or you simply curious about the project. Give Puppet & Brain a try (although lacks of animations and arts). No username password, and no credit card needed! It's free!!

Of course, I still need to pay my Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, and future (current under firebase free tierðŸ˜ž) server hosting and bandwidth cost. Most importantly, your contributions will enable me to work on this project full-time! I eat lots of ice cream, so I also want to keep my ice cream supply.

I also prepared several rewards for my amazing patrons, like you!!!

One last thing

Because I worked in special needs education area for so many years, that I cannot simply ignore the group of children with special educational requirements. I'm glad that I've managed to add switch access capabilities for Puppet & Brain. Your support will further help me to add simple ready to use switch accessible quiz and activity contents in Puppet & Brain for those children with special needs.

Thank you!
