ðŸ˜€Hi, I'm â€‹Liy. I'm creating Puppet & Brain! A creative platform with node based visual scripting for children to learn simple game programming and programming concepts.

I used to work in a special needs company until redundancy happened last October...ðŸ˜… I developed games and applications for children with learning and emotional difficulties, physical disability or sensory impairment.

For the past few months, I've been working on Puppet & Brain using my redundancy compensation. I do programming, design, illustration and animations... basically everything. It is realy hard work but I'm enjoying it, just like developing a piece of special needs softwares. I know somewhere, there will be a group of people who will be benifited by my work. Fortunately, my aunt recently started helping me to market this project, but unfortunately it is not working very well at the moment. It does not have enough contents: animations, sticker arts, sound effects, music and ready to use contents.

I would like to work full-time on this project, and I do feel this project has its own value in education and game sector. And I would like to ask for your help to keep this project going.

## What is Patreon?
Patreon is a website enable you to support creators through monthly payment. You will be able to directly support creator's passion and help them to avoid distractions such as side work. Plus, creators usually have plenty of rewards for you! In my case, I'm passinate about Puppet & Brain which would be helping children to get their first experience on game programming.

## What is Puppet & Brain?

In short, Puppet & Brain is a web application allow children to make simple games and activities by connecting visual nodes.

You might know MIT Scratch, Google Blockly or other children programming platforms. Most of them are based on Google Blockly which mimic line by line text based coding style. They all have jigsaw style blocks, it simulates the code execution by stacking block together.

If you are not a game developer or 3D artist, you probably never heard of node based visual scripting, or node graph system before. Instead of mimic lines of code from a program; node graph system focus on the execution flow and data flow of a program, and it is so intutive that most non-programmers such as artist can also use it to program simple logic. Node based system is very popular among game engines and 3D applications.

I wrote a node based visual scripting system from scratch using JavaScript for Puppet & Brain. I believe this project can fill some of the gaps in teaching children programming. After all, programming is not about typing text line by line. The logic, pattern, data and execution flow are the fundmental concepts of the programming. Plus, children can get the first experience on the node based visual scripting, which are used in all the major AAA game engines, such as Unreal Engine, CryEngine, Unity(Bolt, and other 3rd party plugins), Amazon Lumberyard and so on. Not mention, graphics applications like Maya, 3ds Max, Blender and Substance Designer... they also have node based visual system.

I've got the node based visual scripting system, the basic web application and the simple backend ready. But I still need extra time and money to prepare arts, animations, music and creating regular games in order to inspire children. And of course fixing bugs, adding features! Hopefully, I would be able to afford an programmer, an artist or musician to help me on this project.

## Why support me on this project?

If you have children or you are a teacher, or you just simply want to create simple game. You can use â€‹Puppet & Brain (although lack of animations and arts) now: no username, no password and no credit card needed!! It's free!!

Of course, I still need to pay my Adobe Creative Cloud subscriptions, server and hosting cost. Most importantly, your payment support will help me work on this project as my full-time job! So I don't waste my time on finding a "proper job" or other freelance works. I eat lots of ice cream, at least I want to keep my ice cream supply.

Other than the free Puppet & Brain, which I presented to you, I prepared several rewards for my supporters. Listed on the right side ======>>

Because I worked in special needs education area for so many years, that I cannot simply ignore this group of children with special educational requirements. I'm glad that I've managed to add switch access capabilities to Puppet & Brain. Your support will further help me adding ready to use switch accessible quiz games and activities content in Puppet & Brain for those children with special needs.

Thank you!
