* Node based visual scripting system in editor folder.

The system provides a way to load picture and animation on to the stage, which becomes an actor. Every actor can have its node gragh(brain) defines it behaviours.

There are series of built-in function and event nodes. User can program simple behaviour by adding different node, chaining the execution pin, connecting input to output.

This visual scripting system execute the chained nodes. Since it does not use transpile, actor's behaviour can be modified at the *runtime*.
